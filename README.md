# BalancedCombineManyRings
This mod is based on the [CombineManyRings](https://github.com/SlivaStari/CombineManyRings) mods which allows you to put multiple rings together in the [Forge](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Forge#Combined_Rings), but uses a more balanced and challenging system for creating combined rings with more than two base rings.
