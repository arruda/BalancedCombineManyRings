# BalancedCombineManyRings
This mod is based on the [CombineManyRings](https://github.com/SlivaStari/CombineManyRings) mods which allows you to put multiple rings together in the [Forge](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Forge#Combined_Rings), but uses a more balanced and challenging system for creating combined rings with more than two base rings.The overall idea is that with more than 2 rings it is more costly (100 Cinder Shards per extra ring, max of 999) and also the process becomes more unstable (+20% of chance of failing per ring, starting on 3 rings, up to a maximum of 90% of chance of failure), which will cause one of the rings to be destroyed (it's more likely to destroy the one that has already more rings combined into it) . Here is an example:


Combining 2 Rings - Default cost and behavior
Combining 3 Rings - cost of 100 Cinder Shards and 20% of chance of breaking one of the rings
Combining 4 Rings - cost of 200 Cinder Shards and 40% of change of breaking one of the ring
Combining 6 Rings - cost of 400 Cinder Shards and 80% of change of breaking one of the ring
Combining 7 Rings - cost of 500 Cinder Shards and 90% of change of breaking one of the ring
Combining 12 Rings - cost of 999 Cinder Shards and 90% of change of breaking one of the ring


Therefore to be able to get a lvl 4 Combined Ring (4 rings combined into one) the player will need to expend a total of 300 Cinder Shards (100 for 3 rings, and then another 200 for the 4 rings forge), with an overall probability of success of 48% (80% for the 3 ring forge, and then 60% for the 4 ring forge).
